# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- I want to learn a sceduling libray in preparation for a sceduled texting.
- I need to make the basic menu a fuction to not have so much of the application rely on the main
- I would love to implement a saving system to save your last template from the last time it was used.
